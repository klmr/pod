<p>[WIP]</p>
<p>‘box’ aims to largely replace existing mechanisms for writing and loading reusable code in R. What’s more, the existing mechanism has existed for decades, is used in and supported by the core R language itself, and has a vast ecosystem built around it. It is therefore reasonable to ask what would justify the introduction of a completely new mechanism with a non-standard syntax.</p>
<p>This vignette aims to provide that justification.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>‘box’ aims to unify and entirely replace other, existing mechanisms for loading code in R. The two most notable mechanisms for this are <code>library</code> (or <code>require</code>) and <code>source</code>. In fact, <a href="faq.html#can-i-call-library-require-source-inside-a-module-">neither of these mechanisms should be used in conjunction with ‘box’</a> — doing so interferes with the correct functioning of ‘box’ and defeats its purpose.</p>
<p>If you believe you’ve found a case which requires using <code>library</code> or <code>source</code> in conjunction with ‘box’, please <a href="https://github.com/klmr/box/issues/new">let me know by submitting an issue</a>: I consider these cases to be bugs in ‘box’, and I am keen on fixing them. The only scenario that (currently) requires using a “legacy” package loading function in conjunction with ‘box’ is conditional loading; that is, <code>requireNamespace</code>.</p>
<p>There are two distinct aspects to the design of ‘box’: <em>loading code</em>, and <em>writing reusable code</em>. Although these are closely related concerns, I will attempt to separate them for the purpose of the following discussion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Where relevant, the following discusses the <code>library</code> function. The same applies to <code>require</code>; but <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/51263513/1968"><code>require</code> should not be used anyway</a>.</p>

<div id="boxuse-vs-library" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#boxuse-vs-library" class="anchor"></a><code>box::use</code> <em>vs</em> <code>library</code>
</h3>
<p>The most fundamental difference between <code>library</code> and <code>box::use</code> is that one globally attaches all names exported from a package, and the other doesn’t. This has huge implications: causing global side-effects means that <code>library</code> can never be used in code that needs to be isolated, so it can never be used to construct large, interconnected, modular systems.</p>
<p>That’s also why <code>library</code> mustn’t be called inside packages. Instead, packages import reusable code via a fundamentally different mechanism (namely, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Writing-portable-packages"><code>NAMESPACE</code> declarations</a>): the issues with using <code>library</code> in reusable code are readily apparent.</p>
<p>‘box’ by design allows code reuse to be isolated and controlled, so that it can be employed uniformly <em>everywhere</em>, without causing interferences elsewhere.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="wip-design-rationale">[WIP] design rationale:</h3>
<ul>
<li>default is not to attach: be explicit by default</li>
<li>attaching should be fine-grained: as few names as possible in scope (see Google style guidelines, r-lib/conflicted)</li>
<li>concise syntax, otherwise it doesn’t get used</li>
<li>
<code>attach</code> happens locally</li>
<li>
<code>library</code> clearly <em>is</em> problematic, which is why packages themselves internally have a different mechanism (NAMESPACE). ‘box’ modules unify this.</li>
</ul>
<p>[WIP] ‘box’ does not warn of name conflicts when attaching, since that mechanism is a band-aid necessitated by overly broad attachment of names, and is not needed by modern module systems (case in point: only R has it, no other language sees the need).</p>
<p>[WIP] ‘pacman’</p>
<p>[WIP] Reasons for NSE:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&gt;</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Concise syntax (in particular, don’t force repeating name in assignment — refer to previous syntax, <code>foo = import('foo')</code>)</li>
<li>Encourages thinking of module dependencies of <em>static</em>, simplifying code workflow logically</li>
<li>Modules <em>are not string</em>; eschew stringly typed names</li>
</ul>
<p>[WIP] Syntax matters: nobody uses <code>library(include.only = )</code>.</p>

</div>
<div id="boxuse-vs" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#boxuse-vs" class="anchor"></a><code>box::use</code> <em>vs</em> <code>::</code>
</h3>
<p>All of the above-mentioned issues with <code>library</code> can be avoided by always explicitly qualifying names; that is, by using <code>pkg::name</code> throughout the entire code, instead of <code>library(pkg)</code>, followed by plain <code>name</code> to access names from attached packages.</p>
<p>And quite often this works. However, it also often introduces non-trivial clutter by making code longer without providing relevant information to the reader. This issue of littering code with repeated namespace prefixes is commonly solved in other languages by introducing aliases or shortcuts for namespaces, as well as selectively making symbols from namespaces available without qualification. That’s what <code>NAMESPACE</code> files allow to do in packages, and it’s what <code>box::use</code> allows to do everywhere.</p>
<p>Another, minor issue with using <code>::</code> is that, unlike <code>library</code>, it does not signal an explicit intent to import a dependency. Finding the dependencies of a piece of code is still possible — it is sufficient to scan the parsed code for occurrences of <code>::</code> — but it is less apparent at a glance. By contrast, <code>box::use</code> declarations explicitly signal dependencies.</p>

<p>### ‘box’ modules <em>vs</em> source files</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[WIP] <code>source</code> sees lots of global state, e.g. attached packages at the time of its execution (so do packages to some extent, though discouraged by R CMD check). Modules are isolated and see a consistent state of the workd, in particular, they only attach ‘base’, and they don’t need to deal with the state of the working directory due to <code>box::use</code> and <code>box::file</code> path lookup.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>On the contrary, packages are great! The package ecosystem is probably a large reason for R’s success as a programming language. It did many things right when other languages were still dragging their feet.</p>
<p>That said, there are definitely things that can be improved about packages and how they’re used in R, and some of these things are fairly hard-wired. The following is a non-exhaustive list of things I perceive as issues large and small with packages.</p>
<p>Taken together, these issues all mean that R does not manage code complexity as well as it could: in small projects or individual analysis scripts they are not a big issue; but they become prohibitive for large software projects, and this is one of the reasons that effectively prevents R’s use for software packages above a certain size altogether.</p>
<p>I believe that ‘box’ solves all of them.</p>

<div id="packages-are-monolithic" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#packages-are-monolithic" class="anchor"></a>Packages are monolithic</h2>
<p>Compared with other languages, R packages, on average, tend to export a lot of stuff, and not always well defined around a common functionality. To be clear, there are many great single-purpose packages but, equally, there are many packages that serve as a kind of “utility bag”. This practice violates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle">single-responsibility principle</a>: each software module should provide a single, well-defined functionality.</p>
</div>
<div id="packages-dont-support-namespaces" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#packages-dont-support-namespaces" class="anchor"></a>Packages don’t support namespaces</h2>
<p>In fact, each package in R lives in a <em>single</em> namespace. This in itself was a big achievement when it was introduced. But even when strictly observing the single-responsibility principle, it sometimes makes sense to subdivide a module into individual parts; functionality naturally composes hierarchically. R packages have no way of supporting this. Packages sometimes resort to giving names prefixes that denote different namespaces (e.g. ‘forcats’, with the <code>fct_</code> and <code>lvls_</code> prefixes) but namespaces have several advantages (such as the possibility of dropping the prefix when there’s no ambiguity).</p>
</div>
<div id="package-complexity-discourages-modularisation" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#package-complexity-discourages-modularisation" class="anchor"></a>Package complexity discourages modularisation</h2>
<p>Writing packages has become much easier over the years, largely thanks to ‘devtools’ and other utility packages. Yet wrapping existing functionality into a package is still a non-trivial process involving creating a directory hierarchy and several external configuration files. By contrast, other modern languages allow treating individual code files as packages, and consequently wrapping a piece of code into a reusable software package is as simple as saving it in a separate file. This in itself is insufficient to create a <em>distributable</em> software package, but it immediately creates modularisation within a larger project.</p>
<p>Since R packages do not have nested namespaces, such project-private packages do not exist: a software project that wants to encapsulate part of its functionality needs to create an entire stand-alone package, with no way of indicating that the resulting package is only usable as part of the parent project. As a consequence, people tend not modularise code as much as possible.</p>
</div>
<div id="library-provokes-name-clashes-and-bad-naming" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#library-provokes-name-clashes-and-bad-naming" class="anchor"></a><code>library</code> provokes name clashes and bad naming</h2>
<p>The most common way, by far, of using packages is via <code>library</code>. This imports a package and attaches all of its exported symbols globally. As a consequence, a single scope in R routinely sees hundreds or even thousands of names simultaneously (once we exclude the ‘base’ package). This makes it hard to keep track of what a given name refers to.</p>
<p>Limiting the scope of variables, limiting the number of imported symbols and keeping track of dependencies are central principles of software quality in other programming languages; so much so that some languages by default warn or signal errors when code contains unused imports, and importing unqualified names (the equivalent of <code>library</code>) is strongly discouraged (for instance, <code>from pkg import *</code> is universally frowned upon in Python).</p>
<p>Yet in R this is best practice, and the alternatives are cumbersome and usually restricted to programming in packages: the only non-manual way of importing a limited set of symbols requires placing <code>importFrom</code> declarations <em>outside of the code</em> (either in the package NAMESPACE declaration or in a Roxygen comment). The only other alternative is to always qualify the whole package name and the whole symbol name, via <code>pkg::name</code>.</p>
<p>The justified fear of name clashes sometimes unfortunately encourages bad naming to mitigate the risk. An example of this is the ‘stringr’ package, where most (but not all!) names are prefixed with <code>str_</code>. It makes using these package via explicit qualification more cumbersome because of the unhelpful redundancy it introduces (<code>stringr::str_match</code>). If R packages had proper namespacing, these prefixes wouldn’t exist.</p>
<p>Lastly, except inside a package, R has no concise way of importing names only inside a limited scope: <code>library</code> always attaches a package globally. Packages always import dependencies across the whole package. There is no way to restrict an import to an individual function (or other scope, such as an R6 class).</p>
</div>
<div id="packages-dont-support-circular-dependencies" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#packages-dont-support-circular-dependencies" class="anchor"></a>Packages don’t support circular dependencies</h2>
<p>Admittedly, this is a really minor point. Circular dependencies are inherently problematic, and avoiding them altogether is generally encouraged. Yet occasionally there is a natural circular dependency between two modules, and refactoring the code to remove the circularity would introduce non-trivial complexity. R packages do not allow this, except via “Suggests”. ???</p>
